So..
Week 2 is gonna be Zelda Majora's Mask.

And also Ben Drowned will be the character for the third song.
The characters for the first and second song are very obvious
but I`m not gonna say it yet because they will come with a surprise ;)

When is gonna be finnished?, idk really.
Maybe on christmas hollydays.
Maybe...

About the drawing on the right:
-I've done it long time ago when the mod of Sonic.exe came out.
 Now they are too many mod of creepypastas and I thought that Ben is
 the one missing. So, why don't do it myself?

-That drawing is NOT the definitive design, it was just done for
 the tweet and needs A LOT of improvements.

Week 3? 
No f*k*ng idea...
Oh wait, I just remembered that I've made another OC.
But I don't know if it's gonna be week 3 or 4.
